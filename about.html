    <h1>Hi,</h1> <h3> It's great to meet you! </h3>

    <p>Design is an essential part of the Video games industry and here I am converging my diverse experiences into making games.

      Hi, I'm Trish and I make games. I have worked on various projects ranging from 2D to 3D games varying from platformers to point-and-click adventure genres. My skill lies in holistic design of the game; game balancing and system design. I have eventually gained interest in designing game economies. 
      
      The themes within game that interest me are Psychology, Sustainability, Handicraft sector, Indian lifestyle translating into genres like serious, simulation, puzzle, RPG.
      
      I am good at leading teams and enjoy working with different mix of people.
      
      I have been an active member in the Student body of my college, NID Bangalore. I have been the core coordinator for 'Student placement committee' in August '22 as well as been the Class representative and the head of the Election committee during '22. 
      
      I hosted the introductory session by Adobe during the webinar series held for NID students in August '22. 
      
      I have been a part of the winning team 'Srujan' in Samsung E.D.G.E. '22 where we were the runners up for our design solution that we presented on 'Modern ways of direct communication with consumer'
      
      My internship experience includes being a research assistant for the book 'Indian Craft Interiors' that was released by Mapin Publishing later in 2022.
      
      I'd like to experience and work more for the betterment of the community that I belong to.</p>
